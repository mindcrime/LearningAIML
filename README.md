# LearningAIML
Repo of the code I write as I learn AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language).

learningAIML_1 - this dir contains a complete AIML bot that can respond to 3 possible inputs.  It's basically the "Hello World" of AIML bots.  Not interactive, the inputs are hardcoded and all it does is println() the output.

xmpp-aiml-bot - this dir contains a complete AIML bot that's wired up to XMPP so you can chat with it interactively.  Still just a "Hello World" example as far as AIML goes, and only responds to 3 inputs in its current form.
